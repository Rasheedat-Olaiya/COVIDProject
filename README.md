### Project Overview
---

This Project aims to explore the data sets of COVID-19 deaths and vaccine populations across the world using SQL to provide insights into the country with the highest population of death/ vaccinated rate.


### Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is the "CovidVaccinations.csv" and "CovidDeathss.csv" files. 

### Tools

- mySQL Workbench (Data Importation, Exploration and Analysis)
   - [Download here]([https://www.mysql.com/downloads/])


### Data Importation and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Importing the csv files into the Database(Schema)
2. Checking and exploring the tables.

### Explorative Data Analysis

involved exploring some answers to key questions, such as:

- What is the likelihood of dying If you contract covid in your country?
- What are the Percentage of population that contracted covid?
- Which countries have the highest Infection rate per population?
- Which countries have the highest Death count per population


### Data Analysis

Analysis was carried out using the mySQL Workbench.


### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The likelihood of dying if you contract COVId in united kingdom in 2021 is an average of 2.9%.
2. The country with the highest infection rate per population is "Andorra".
3. The country with the highest death count per population is "North America"


### Limitations


I had to change the csv file from UTF8 to be able to import it into mySQL server and also needed to change the data type of some of the columns during analysis.
